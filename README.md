# CommunereTest

It was a project that I need to create for the Communere company's interview to show my Backend skill, and prove I can work with .Net Core, in Micro Service Environment, And that I can run it on Docker.

The Project, does not provide User Interface, Gateway Server, or Load Balancer, nor any configuration for them.
